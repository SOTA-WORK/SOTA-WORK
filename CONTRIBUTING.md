# How to contribute
We are very happy that you found this project and want to contribute.

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to SOTA-WORK](https://github.com/SOTA-WORK/SOTA-WORK/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). 

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:
``` shell
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```
Before PR, first describe the content of your upcoming PR in Issues and why you recommend it. Use `#`**(E.g:#1)** to associate your Issue with the PR.
